## 课外活动与健康(The Importance of Extracurricular Activities)
	In recent years,there has been a big growth in the area of extracurricular activities.They are so popular on campus that they have become an indispensable part of college education.

	Extracurricular activities contribute both to students' physical well-being and to their mental fitness.There is a new appreciation of the significance of after-class activities as students' bodies are increasingly weak and vulnerable to disease because of inactivity.School authorities,as well as students themselves,have realized that sports are especially necessary to a person who works with his brain most of the day.Besides,extracurricular activities offer a heathy form of escape from their monotonous routine studies. Taking part in swimming,jogging and ball games can make their academic life richer and fuller.And most importantly,after-class activities help to promote the development of a student's personality.Such traits of character as competitiveness,self-discpline,teamwork and edurance-the things much needed in their late career and life-are encouraged and cultivated in sports.

	Extracurricular activities play a vital role in a student's life, and it deserves further attention from clooeges and universities.
## 旅行的意义
	Travel is something we all crave for.Not only could it feast us on spectacular sceneries,it also broadens our minds. To travel is to discover the new and the unknown;it's a learning experience,whcih could expand our realm of knowledge of various kinds.
	Travel is not just about packing up your lifestyle and taking them on the road;to a large extent , it means understanding different people and cultures.I still remember my first trip to Yunnan,where I was amazed by the unique marriage custom of thr Mo Suo Minority,by the beautiful folk songs and legends of Bai people, by the Karst caves in the Stone Forest, and by the ideological concept as well as social structures constituted under different periods of times. During the journey ,I kept meeting travelers from diffent places;we exchanged opinions on making travel plans and solviong urgent problems encountered on the road. In a sense, travel does not only equip me with knowledge in geography and history , but alse help to improve my communication skills.
	Travel is more than the seeing of sights, it aloows us to learn to grow, to bring back lots of newfound knowledge. In brief, travel broadens the mind.
## 保持健康的方法
	As the living standard improves, more and more people are paying attetion to their healthy conditions. Diffenrent people usually have different ways to dstay healthy. In my opinion the most important thing is to keep a healthy attitude toward life.
	It's ture that physical factors affect one's health conditions a great deal, but at the same time we should not neglect the mental factors. Many scientific researchers have known that anger,suspicion and anxiety do great harm to human bodies, while being optimistic can cure some small diseases. We have also heard of a great many people who live much longer than doctors' prediciton after they have been diagnosed incurable diseases. That
